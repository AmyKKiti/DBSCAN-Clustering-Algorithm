# DBSCAN-Clustering-Algorithm
Data clustering algorithm named DBSCAN - Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. Given a large set of data points in a space of arbitrary dimension and given a distance metric, this algorithm can discover clusters of different shapes and sizes, marking as outliers isolated points in low-density regions.
